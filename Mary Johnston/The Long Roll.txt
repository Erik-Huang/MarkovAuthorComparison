TO THE READER

To name the historians, biographers, memoir and narrative writers,
diarists, and contributors of but a vivid page or two to the magazines
of Historical Societies, to whom the writer of a story dealing with this
period is indebted, would be to place below a very long list. In lieu of
doing so, the author of this book will say here that many incidents
which she has used were actual happenings, recorded by men and women
writing of that through which they lived. She has changed the manner but
not the substance, and she has used them because they were "true
stories" and she wished that breath of life within the book. To all
recorders of these things that verily happened, she here acknowledges
her indebtedness and gives her thanks.

THE LONG ROLL




CHAPTER I

THE BOTETOURT RESOLUTIONS


On this wintry day, cold and sunny, the small town breathed hard in its
excitement. It might have climbed rapidly from a lower land, so
heightened now were its pulses, so light and rare the air it drank, so
raised its mood, so wide, so very wide the opening prospect. Old
red-brick houses, old box-planted gardens, old high, leafless trees, out
it looked from its place between the mountain ranges. Its point of view,
its position in space, had each its value--whether a lesser value or a
greater value than other points and positions only the Judge of all can
determine. The little town tried to see clearly and to act rightly. If,
in this time so troubled, so obscured by mounting clouds, so tossed by
winds of passion and of prejudice, it felt the proudest assurance that
it was doing both, at least that self-infatuation was shared all around
the compass.

The town was the county-seat. Red brick and white pillars, set on rising
ground and encircled by trees, the court house rose like a guidon,
planted there by English stock. Around it gathered a great crowd,
breathlessly listening. It listened to the reading of the Botetourt
Resolutions, offered by the President of the Supreme Court of Virginia,
and now delivered in a solemn and a ringing voice. The season was
December and the year, 1860.

       *       *       *       *       *

    _The people of Botetourt County, in general meeting assembled,
    believe it to be the duty of all the citizens of the Commonwealth,
    in the present alarming condition of our country, to give some
    expression of their opinion upon the threatening aspect of public
    affairs....

    In the controversies with the mother country, growing out of the
    effort of the latter to tax the Colonies without their consent, it
    was Virginia who, by the resolution against the Stamp Act, gave the
    example of the first authoritative resistance by a legislative body
    to the British Government, and so imparted the first impulse to the
    Revolution.

    Virginia declared her Independence before any of the Colonies, and
    gave the first written Constitution to mankind.

    By her instructions her representatives in the General Congress
    introduced a resolution to declare the Colonies independent States,
    and the Declaration itself was written by one of her sons.

    She furnished to the Confederate States the father of his country,
    under whose guidance Independence was achieved, and the rights and
    liberties of each State, it was hoped, perpetually established.

    She stood undismayed through the long night of the Revolution,
    breasting the storm of war and pouring out the blood of her sons
    like water on every battlefield, from the ramparts of Quebec to the
    sands of Georgia._

A cheer broke from the throng. "That she did--that she did! 'Old Virginia
never tire.'"

    _By her unaided efforts the Northwestern Territory was conquered,
    whereby the Mississippi, instead of the Ohio River, was recognized
    as the boundary of the United States by the treaty of peace.

    To secure harmony, and as an evidence of her estimate of the value
    of the Union of the States, she ceded to all for their common
    benefit this magnificent region--an empire in itself.

    When the Articles of Confederation were shown to be inadequate to
    secure peace and tranquillity at home and respect abroad, Virginia
    first moved to bring about a more perfect Union.

    At her instance the first assemblage of commissioners took place at
    Annapolis, which ultimately led to a meeting of the Convention which
    formed the present Constitution.

    The instrument itself was in a great measure the production of one
    of her sons, who has been justly styled the Father of the
    Constitution.

    The government created by it was put into operation, with her
    Washington, the father of his country, at its head; her Jefferson,
    the author of the Declaration of Independence, in his cabinet; her
    Madison, the great advocate of the Constitution, in the legislative
    hall._

"And each of the three," cried a voice, "left on record his judgment as
to the integral rights of the federating States."

    _Under the leading of Virginia statesmen the Revolution of 1798 was
    brought about, Louisiana was acquired, and the second war of
    independence was waged.

    Throughout the whole progress of the Republic she has never
    infringed on the rights of any State, or asked or received an
    exclusive benefit.

    On the contrary, she has been the first to vindicate the equality of
    all the States, the smallest as well as the greatest.

    But, claiming no exclusive benefit for her efforts and sacrifices in
    the common cause, she had a right to look for feelings of fraternity
    and kindness for her citizens from the citizens of other States....
    And that the common government, to the promotion of which she
    contributed so largely, for the purpose of establishing justice and
    ensuring domestic tranquillity, would not, whilst the forms of the
    Constitution were observed, be so perverted in spirit as to inflict
    wrong and injustice and produce universal insecurity.

    These reasonable expectations have been grievously disappointed--_

There arose a roar of assent. "That's the truth!--that's the plain truth!
North and South, we're leagues asunder!--We don't think alike, we don't
feel alike, and we don't interpret the Constitution alike! I'll tell you
how the North interprets it!--Government by the North, for the North, and
over the South! Go on, Judge Allen, go on!"

    _In view of this state of things, we are not inclined to rebuke or
