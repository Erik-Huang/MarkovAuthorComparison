# MarkovAuthorComparison
## Input Preparation

Use processBooks.py to fetch booklist for any authors and download any books you want. However, make sure to use new list in the author list to avoid overwriting existing data.

## Matrix Generation

Use markovAll.py to generate all matrices located in the folder of each author. The result will be put into new folders named: author + Matrices.

## Matrix Analysis

For an overview of all matrices, check overallCompare.m.

Load [allMatrices.mat](./allMatrices.mat) to load all 95 tagged matrices into the program to perform detailed analyzing on specific books or authors.
